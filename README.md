# Great Walks in NZ 

## About ‚ÑπÔ∏è

This is my very first project built with a group. The application provides a brief introduction to the Great Walks in New Zealand. While it may not be fancy, it is one of the projects I am truly passionate about and had a lot of fun creating. I am still very proud of this application.
